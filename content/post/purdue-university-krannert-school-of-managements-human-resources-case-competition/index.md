I recently had the wonderful opportunity to represent Penn State School of Labor and Employment Relations at Purdue University Krannert School of Management's Human Resources Case Competition. I was able to work alongside three of my classmates to prepare a solution to the case presented by PepsiCo. Leading up to our presentation, we reviewed past cases and solidified our understanding of our chosen framework, the change kaleidoscope. After receiving the case and finalizing our proposed solutions, we presented our ideas to a panel of judges.\

Overall, this was a unique developmental opportunity. I not only had the chance to practice my consulting skills but also had the chance to network with HR professionals and the other competing teams.
