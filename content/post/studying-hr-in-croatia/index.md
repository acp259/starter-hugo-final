This past semester I had the privilege of participating in HRER 897: Comparative Employment Relations with Penn State University’s Human Resources and Employment Relations M.S. program. This course focused on learning the practice of human resource management in the European Union. This opportunity also included a one-week international abroad experience in Zagreb, Croatia where we were able to see the practice of human resource management in a country with membership in the European Union.   

Our time in Croatia was enlightening, having the opportunity to learn from professionals in the industry at Rimac Technology, Infobip, 3M, Plitvice Lakes National Parkand, Zagrebačka pivovara, Coca Cola, and the commercial trade union of Croatia. I especially enjoyed our discussion around the impact of Croatia's membership in the European Union. While private companies saw this as an opportunity to extend their net for talent, public companies were unsure of whether they'd have enough applicants to fill positions. One of our speakers explained that because public companies must follow the job qualifications and pay rates set by the government, they feared that citizens would take advantage of their new membership and go elsewhere to work. This makes me wonder if we will see a similar trend as other countries continue to make work visas more obtainable as a method of securing strong talent, and if so, will the United States consider doing the same?
