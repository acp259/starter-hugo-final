Last week I had the privilege of representing Penn State University’s Human Resources and Emploment Relations MS program at the Future of HR Conference. This experience provided opportunities to network with HR students from 11 different programs across the county, as well as learn from established professionals in the field, including [Marcia Avedon, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAABcWJkBhZwNgVKZxz3JD8_eX_mjFZPIggI), [Pam Kimmet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAMFpVUBonBDs5TfiKgak03Qww02Q37Yhd0), [Tim Richmond](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAGSfCoBDv9Xh_xfdtOtBwo3kypFTFoo_qw), and [Dave Ulrich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA1d7y4BWAAA6u2acERUBbRPkj9w5WTJF_M). The discussions we had at the conference were insightful and I am grateful to have been in attendance.\

In addition to networking opportunities and guest speaker panels, a large portion of our time was dedicated to creating a TikTok educating others on what HR actually involves and why they should pursue it. I had the pleasure of working with fellow students from Cornell University, Purdue University, and the University of South Carolina. In addition to all the great dialouge our multi-university team had around our profession, we also won "most creative TikTok".
